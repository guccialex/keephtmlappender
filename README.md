# keephtmlappender


# the python file is put in the same directory as the html files created by the extraction of the takeout archive. When run it creates a new folder in that directory called "htmlandtext" and creates an html and a text version of all the keep notes inside of it.


# Working: The creation of the HTML file with all the text and pictures and proper formatting

# Not Working: The .txt file right now is just the .html file with a different extension.
